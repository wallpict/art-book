<p><strong>Hydroseeding Drawing Sketch Detail Showing Truck Spraying</strong>, Hydroseeding is an efficient technique used to cost-effectively revegetate large areas that include steep slopes delivering lower prices per hectare than other techniques. Some will put the hose over their shoulder which is a very comfortable way to hydroseed. Spraying somewhere close to horizontal will give you the best build up of a mulch layer compared to other techniques.</p>

<p>Hydroseeding is the process of combining seed mulch healthy soil amendments and fertilizers with water to form a thick slurry. HydroSeeding is a process where seed and any combination of fertilizer lime biostimulants moisture retention polymers tackifiers and other additives are combined with water and a hydroseeding. This slurry is sprayed over the ground surface in a uniform layer to establish vegetation for erosion control. The first tank was applied using the turret gun with a direct spray nozzle and the other 2 tanks I used the turret gun with a fan nozzle.
